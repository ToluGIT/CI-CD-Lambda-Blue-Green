# AWS Lambda Deployment with Blue-Green Deployment using Jenkins and AWS CodeDeploy

This project demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to deploy an AWS Lambda function with blue-green deployment managed by AWS CodeDeploy. The pipeline automates the process of packaging, uploading, and deploying the Lambda function, ensuring zero downtime and seamless updates. It integrates with multiple AWS services such as **S3, Lambda, CloudFormation, CodeDeploy, and SNS**; focus on static code analysis with **Bandit** and infrastructure scanning with **cfn-nag** and sends notifications upon successful deployment.

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS Credentials** with access to:
   - S3  
   - Lambda  
   - CloudFormation  
   - CodeDeploy  
   - SNS  

2. **Jenkins Server** with the following plugins installed:
   - AWS Credentials Plugin  
   - Git Plugin  

4. **S3 Bucket** to store the Lambda ZIP file.

## Pipeline Workflow

1.  **Checkout Code**
    
    *   The pipeline pulls the latest code from the **main branch** of the GitHub repository.
      
2.  **Security Scans**
    
    *   **Static Code Analysis with Bandit:** Scans Python code for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Infrastructure as Code Scanning with cfn-nag:** Analyzes CloudFormation templates for security issues.
      
3.  **Evaluate Security Reports**
    
    *   The pipeline evaluates the results from the security scans.
    *   If any critical vulnerabilities are found, the build fails, preventing deployment.
      
4.  **Build Lambda Package**
    
    *   The Lambda function code and **`appspec.yaml`** are compressed into a **ZIP file**.
5.  **Upload to S3**
    
    *   The ZIP file is uploaded to the specified **S3 bucket** for deployment.
6.  **Deploy to Lambda**
    
    *   If the Lambda function exists, the pipeline **updates the function code**.
    *   If it doesn’t exist, the **CloudFormation template** creates it along with any required infrastructure.
7.  **Update AppSpec File**
    
    *   The **`appspec.yaml`** file is updated with the **current and target Lambda function versions**.
8.  **Blue-Green Deployment**
    
    *   Traffic is **shifted to the new version** using CodeDeploy.
    *   If an issue occurs, traffic can quickly **roll back** to the previous version.
9.  **Notifications**
    
    *   A notification is sent to **SNS** upon successful deployment.

   Security Enhancements
    
 This project incorporates DevSecOps practices by integrating security checks into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that only secure and compliant code is deployed.
    
  ### **1\. Static Code Analysis with Bandit**

  *   **Tool Used:** [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  *   **Purpose:** Scans the Python code (`lambda_function.py`) for security issues like hardcoded credentials, weak cryptography, and injection vulnerabilities.
  *   **Integration:** Added as a pipeline stage called **"Security: Static Code Analysis"**.
    
    

    
### **2\. Infrastructure as Code Scanning with cfn-nag**
    
   *   **Tool Used:** [cfn-nag](https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag)
   *   **Purpose:** Analyzes the CloudFormation template (`deployment.yaml`) for security vulnerabilities, such as insecure configurations and permissive policies.
   *   **Integration:** Added as a pipeline stage called **"Security: Infrastructure Scan"**.

### **3\. Security Report Evaluation**
    
 *   **Purpose:** Parses the reports generated by the security tools.
 *   **Integration:** Added as a pipeline stage called **"Security: Evaluate Reports"**.
 *   **Behavior:** If critical vulnerabilities are found, the pipeline fails to prevent insecure code from being deployed.

  ### **4\. Credentials and Secrets Management**
  
  *   **AWS Credentials:** Stored securely in Jenkins using the **Credentials Plugin**.
  *   **Access Keys and Secrets:** Managed through Jenkins credentials and injected into the pipeline as environment variables.

  ### **5\. IAM Roles and Permissions**
    
 *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** IAM roles (`LambdaExecutionRole` and `CodeDeployServiceRole`) are configured with minimal required permissions.
 *   **Policy Validation:** IAM policies are reviewed to ensure they do not grant excessive permissions.
    
  ### **6\. Secure Storage and Transmission**
    
  *   **S3 Bucket Security:** The S3 bucket used for storing the Lambda package is secured with proper access controls and encryption at rest.
  *   **Encryption:** Data in transit is secured using HTTPS when uploading to S3.
    
  ### **7\. Logging and Monitoring**
    
   *   **Pipeline Logs:** Jenkins pipeline logs are maintained for audit purposes.
   *   **AWS CloudWatch:** Used for monitoring Lambda function execution and logging.

## Conclusion

By integrating security checks directly into the CI/CD pipeline, this project not only ensures seamless and reliable deployments but also promotes a security-first mindset throughout the development process. We have demonstrated how tools like **Bandit** and **cfn-nag** can be effectively used to identify and mitigate potential security risks before they reach production.

Building on AWS services and Jenkins, this project showcases a practical approach to implementing DevSecOps principles in a serverless application environment. It emphasizes the importance of automating security tasks to enhance efficiency without compromising on safety.

I hope this project serves as a valuable resource for you to build your own secure CI/CD pipelines. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
